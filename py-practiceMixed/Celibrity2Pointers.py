# Method 4: This method uses Two Pointers technique to solve the above problem.
#
# Approach: The idea is to use two pointers, one from start and one from the end. Assume the start person
# is A, and the end person is B. If A knows B, then A must not be the celebrity. Else, B must not be the
# celebrity. At the end of the loop, only one index will be left as a celebrity. Go through each person
# again and check whether this is the celebrity.
# The Two Pointer approach can be used where two pointers can be assigned, one at the start and other at
# the end and the elements can be compared and the search space can be reduced.
# Algorithm :
# Create two indices a and b, where a = 0 and b = n-1
# Run a loop until a is less than b.
# Check if a knows b, then a can be celebrity. so incement a, i.e. a++
# Else b cannot be celebrity, so decrement b, i.e. bâ€“
# Assign a as the celebrity
# Run a loop from 0 to n-1 and find the count of persons who knows the celebrity and the number of people
# whom the celebrity knows. if the count of persons who knows the celebrity is n-1 and the count of people
# whom the celebrity knows is 0 then return the id of celebrity else return -1.

# more like static variable in java global.

# Time Complexity: O(n).
# Total number of comparisons 2(N-1), so the time complexity is O(n).
# Space Complexity : O(1).
# No extra space is required.
