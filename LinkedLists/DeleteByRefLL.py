# Given only a pointer/reference to a node to be deleted in a singly linked list,
# how do you delete it?
# Given a pointer to a node to be deleted, delete the node. Note that we
# donâ€™t have pointer to head node.
"""
A simple solution is to traverse the linked list until you find the node you want to delete.
But this solution requires pointer to the head node which contradicts the problem statement.

Fast solution is to copy the data from the next node to the node to be deleted and delete the
next node. Something like following."""

# I can do that in a for loop, but maybe there is some cool "one-liner"?

# ANSWER == STACK OVERFLOW ===>
# Given a list of lists l,
# flat_list = [item for sublist in l for item in sublist]
#
# which means:
# flat_list = []
# for sublist in l:
#     for item in sublist:
#         flat_list.append(item)
