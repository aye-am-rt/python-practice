# Swap Kth node from beginning with Kth node from end in a Linked List
# Given a singly linked list, swap kth node from beginning with kth node from end. Swapping of
# data is not allowed, only pointers should be changed. This requirement may be logical in many
# situations where the linked list data part is huge (For example student details line Name,
# RollNo, Address, ..etc). The pointers are always fixed (4 bytes for most of the compilers).

# The problem seems simple at first look, but it has many interesting cases.
#
# Let X be the kth node from beginning and Y be the kth node from end. Following are the
# interesting cases that must be handled.
# 1) Y is next to X
# 2) X is next to Y
# 3) X and Y are same
# 4) X and Y donâ€™t exist (k is more than number of nodes in linked list)
