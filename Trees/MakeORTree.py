""" Convert a given Binary tree to a tree that holds Logical OR property
Given a Binary Tree (Every node has at most 2 children) where each node has value either 0 or 1.
The task is to convert the given Binary tree to a tree that holds Logical OR property, i.e.,
each node value should be the logical OR between its children."""

# Explanation:
# Given Tree
#       1
#      / \
#     1    0
#    / \   / \
#   0   1  1  1
#
# After Processing
#         1
#       /    \
#      1       1
#     /  \    /  \
#     0   1   1   1

"""
Approach:
The idea is to traverse given binary tree in post order fashion because in post order traversal 
both the children of the root has already been visited before the root itself.
For each node check (recursively) if the node has one children then we donâ€™t have any need to 
check else if the node has both its child then simply update the node data with the 
logic or of its child data.
