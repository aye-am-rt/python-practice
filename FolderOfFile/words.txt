By default, all fields in your return iterable will be rendered as-is.
While this works great when youâ€™re just dealing with Python data structures, it can become very frustrating when working with objects.
To solve this problem, Flask-RESTful provides the fields module and the marshal_with() decorator.
Similar to the Django ORM and WTForm, you use the fields module to describe the structure of your response.

Flask-RESTful understands multiple kinds of return values from view methods.
Similar to Flask, you can return any iterable and it will be converted into a response, including raw Flask response objects.
Flask-RESTful also support setting the response code and response headers using multiple return values, as shown below.
